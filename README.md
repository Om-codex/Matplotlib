## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each folder contains `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) files demonstrating how to create specific types of plots with clean and well-commented code.

| 2   | **Bar Chart**                 | Compares quantities across categories |
| 3   | **Horizontal Bar Chart**     | Same as bar chart but horizontal |
| 4   | **Pie Chart**                | Displays part-to-whole relationships |
| 5   | **Scatter Plot**             | Shows relationships between two variables |
| 6   | **Histogram**                | Displays distribution of a dataset |
| 7   | **Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker)**| Shows distribution with quartiles and outliers |
| 8   | **Stacked Bar Chart**        | Bar chart with segments stacked |
| 9   | **Area Chart**               | Like line plot but filled below line |
| 10  | **Subplots**                 | Multiple plots in one figure |
| 11  | **Multiple Line Plots**      | Line plot with multiple data lines |
| 12  | **Filled Line Plot**         | Uses `fill_between()` for shaded areas |
| 13  | **Error Bars**               | Displays variability using error bars |
| 14  | **Polar Plot**               | Plot data in polar coordinates |
| 15  | **3D Plot (Line, Scatter, Surface)** | 3D visualizations using `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` |
| 16  | **Heatmap (using Matplotlib)** | Visualize matrix-like data |
| 17  | **Customizations**           | Title, labels, legend, grid, style |
| 18  | **Annotations & Text**       | Adding labels and notes to plots |
